## Implementation Phases

   - Basic user dashboard.
   - Basic user authentication.
2. **Phase 2 - Expanded Features**:

3. **Phase 3 - Additional improvements**:

## Technical Considerations
- **ReactJS for Frontend**: Use React to build the UI, starting with basic functional components.
- **Responsive Design**: Use a framework like Material UI or Tailwind CSS for a responsive layout.
- **State Management**: Start simple, using React's built-in state management, and consider Context API or Redux for more complex state management as the application grows.
- **Routing**: Utilize React Router for navigation between different pages and components.
