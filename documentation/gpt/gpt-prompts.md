- **Introduction**

I've decided to start implementing a project similar to uptime robot. The whole idea of this effort is to deepen my knowledge of Java Spring Boot, React and exercise different public cloud providers (Amazon, AWS).

Keypoint to take into consideration:
Technology:
- Spring Boot (latest version)
- ReactJS
- Keycloak (Identity Provider)

Architecture:
- For rest services I want to focus on modular monolith and clean architecture.
- ReactJS, please keep it simple and use predefined UI Styles like Material UI or Tailwind.
- SSO done through Keycloak.
- Unit, Acceptance and E2E Testing should be considered as well.

Functionality:
- Focus on basic functionalities of uptimerobot.com
- Ping Patrol should be the most basic version of uptimerobot.com
- Please consider that UI knowledge is limited. Also Design knowledge is limited too.
- Product should be entire free for now.
- For the fist version should be just two types of users: user, admin.

Deployment

I would be happy to know your opinion on this.

For the next steps I will ask you to help me to create the planning for the project. I want to split the development in multiple phases (incremental versions).
