# ping-patrol

## Description

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and follow the setup instructions. This template is a living document and will continue to be updated with additional features and improvements. We look forward to your contributions and feedback!

Remember, the purpose of this project is to serve as a guideline and starting point. Feel free to modify it according to the needs of your own project and team. Happy coding!

## Local Setup

### Build Project

- Publish api specification in maven local repository

```bash
cd ping-patrol-service-api
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

- Build Service

```bash
cd ping-patrol-service
./gradlew clean build 
```

### Start External Services

For now external services are consisted of:
- Database
- Keycloak

Navigate to `scripts/local-setup` directory and run:

```bash
./local-setup.sh restart ping-patrol-db
./local-setup.sh restart keycloak --rebuild
```

As you can observe we start `keycloak` with a `--rebuild` flag. This is because we have extended the default `jboss/keycloak` image with our own custom provider `ping-patrol-keycloak-custom-provider`.

Keycloak Admin Console:
- link: http://127.0.0.1:9080
- username: admin
- password: admin

Database Credentials:
- database_name: pingpatrol_db
- username: pingpatrol
- port: 3306


### Start Rest API Service

- Start `ping-patrol-service` by running:

```bash
cd ping-patrol-service
./gradlew bootRun
```

Service will realms and authentication details like realms and clients in keycloak service:
- clientId: pingpatrol-webapp
- clientId: pingpatrol-client
- roles: ["admin", "user"]
- users:
  - username: admin@test.com, password: admin
  - username: user@test.com, password: user

Example request for obtaining a token from outside the Docker container:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:9080/realms/pingpatrol/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=password' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=pingpatrol-webapp' \
--data-urlencode 'username=admin@test.com' \
--data-urlencode 'password=admin' \
--data-urlencode 'scope=openid'
```
